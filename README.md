# DEVELOPMENT-OF-ROBOTIC-OPERATING-SYSTEM-ROS-BASED-LANE-FOLLOWING-USING-COMPUTER-VISION-TECHNIQUES-
-This project is developed to evaluate an autonomous mobile robot using Robotic operating System framework and vision technology.
-the process begin with the idea of autonomous car for future using image processing technique to scanning the surrounding of the car.
-Robotic Operating System is used for the car to do multiple task at the same time such as object detection, lane detection, and obstacle avoidance.
-With the system used, it able to run multiple program at the same times.
-so there will be multiple code will be used in order to make it autonomous,
-a few fillter will be used in this code, such as Hough transform filter where the program identify a trajectory of line, Gaussian filter andd canny edge detection.
-hope this will make you understand the process of the project.
