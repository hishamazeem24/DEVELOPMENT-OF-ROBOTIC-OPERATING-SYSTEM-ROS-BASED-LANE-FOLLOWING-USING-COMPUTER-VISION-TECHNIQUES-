# DEVELOPMENT-OF-ROBOTIC-OPERATING-SYSTEM-ROS-BASED-LANE-FOLLOWING-USING-COMPUTER-VISION-TECHNIQUES-
This project is developed to evaluate an autonomous mobile robot using Robotic operating System framework and vision technology.
the process begin with the idea of autonomous car for future using image processing technique to scanning the surrounding of the car.
Robotic Operating System is used for the car to do multiple task at the same time such as object detection, lane detection, and obstacle avoidance.
With the system used, it able to run multiple program at the same times.
so there will be multiple code will be used in order to make it autonomous,
a few fillter will be used in this code, such as Hough transform filter where the program identify a trajectory of line, Gaussian filter andd canny edge detection.
hope this will make you understand the process of the project.
